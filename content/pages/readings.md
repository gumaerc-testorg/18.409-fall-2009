## Readings on Spectral Graph Theory

Andersen, R., F. Chung, K. Lang. "[Local Graph Partitioning using PageRank Vectors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4031383)" in *Proceedings of the 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science*, 475-486. Washington, DC: IEEE, October 21-24, 2006.

> This is the conference version of Andesen, Chung, and Lang paper on local cutting with PageRank vectors. There is also a longer journal version.

Dan Spielman's Notes on Lovasz-Simonovits Theorem

> Notes from Dan Spielman's course on *Spectral Graph Theory* about the Lovasz-Simonovits theorem. ({{% resource_link "0881d6e3-e4cf-fd9b-c180-cfced61579f0" "PDF" %}}) (Courtesy of Dan Spielman. Used with permission.)

Jerrum, M., and A. Sinclaire. "Approximating the Permanent." *SIAM Journal on Computing* 18 (1989): 1149-1178.

> This is the original Jerrum-Sinclair paper on approximating the permanent. I looked for a nice textbook writeup or set of lecture notes for the result, but this paper is so beautifully written that I think it's still the best place to read about the result. We'll only cover pp. 1149-1160 (in the journal's page numbers).

Motwani, Rajeev, and Prabhakar Raghavan. *Randomized Algorithms*. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780521474658.   
See section 11.3. This is the section of Motwani and Raghavan's book "*Randomized Algorithms*." that covers approximating the permanent.

Dan Spielman's Example Computations

> These are notes from a lecture given in another class that covered spectral graph theory. In them, many of the examples from today's class (including the grid graph and graph products) are worked out in detail.
